#demo of odometer and rtcm messaging over UDP

# to edit, see the #CHANGE TO:  comments
# change A1_ip with ip address of your unit on your network, which is shown in user configurations
# change odometer_udb_port and data_udp_port to open ports on your computer.
#   set the same ports as UDP COMPUTER DATA PORT and UDP COMPUTER ODOMETER PORT user configurations.
#   If your unit has no udp odometer port, use the udp config port. After upgrading you should change it to odometer port.
# change the "if counter % 100000 == 0" to a checks if the odometer or rtcm data is ready.
#   select.select is a good way to check, as shown for the unit's output.
#   If you use a different check, it it should prevent a single measurement from being sent repeatedly.
#   When not ready, it should return False immediately and not wait to be ready. Otherwise it will block the other messages.
# change speed to the speed from your odometer
# change rtcm_data to your data
